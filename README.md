# Hi, faye here! 
You can picture me as another one of those stereotypical queer neurodivergent nerds.

I use GitHub for projects that are already hosted here and avoid using this platform otherwise.

## My current tech related skills include:
- Linux, mostly NixOS
- 3D modelling
- Graphic design
- Basic Java & Python

## I'm trying to get into:
- Web development
- Rust
- *way too much more*
